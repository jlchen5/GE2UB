R script for predicting the ubiquitin by gene expression matrix


An example code of a machine learning based model for gene expression prediction of protein ubiquitination is provided here, written in R. This model can help to predict which genes play important roles in protein ubiquitination.

First, we need to prepare data, including gene expression data and known protein ubiquitination data. We will use the publicly available dataset [GSE76005]
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE76005), which includes gene expression data and protein ubiquitination data from `human breast cancer` tissue and normal tissue.
